These tests where run with the following specs:
Dell Precision 3530 - Ubuntu 18.04.06 LTS 
Oracle VM VirtualBox g.1.0 r135406 (Qt5.9.5):
  MininetVM: Ubuntu 18.04.05 LTS
    Mininet: 2.3.0
    Ryu: 4.34
  
  Base Memory: 16384 MB
  Processors: 4
  Boot Order: Floppy, Optical, Hard Disk
  Acceleration: VT-x/AMD-V, Nested Paging, PAE/NX, KVM Paravirtualization
  Storage: 256 GB
  Video Memory: 16 MB

How to install most requirements:
pip install ryu #SDN controller
pip install pydot graphviz #For visualization of the Mininet Topology
sudo apt-get install tcpdump
pip install scapy pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install joblib


TESTS:
Tests are in order, commands are in readme within each subfolder. 
label_preprocess_create_model.py, custom_ryu_controller.py, graph.py, begge.py, is tweaked to fit scenario.

label_preprocess_create_model.py is changed to use different features, calculate different metrics(hyperparameter, feature ranking, performance metrics).
custom_ryu_controller.py is changed to use different features, models and to include/exclude mitigation. functionality/calculations stay the same, to have a continous/matchin setup creating as few error sources as possible.


traffic_gen_norm_ddos.py, netGen.py, custom_topology.py, processor.py, ryu-config.conf stays the same throughout.
